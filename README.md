# Wrangle_twitter_data
This repo contains a wrangling effort performed in accordance to a Udacity course.
This report will be used to gather, wrangle and clean data from the twitter user WeRateDogs's tweets about dogs on twitter and their ratings.
This report will also include a simple analysis of which dogs are more popular than the rest. Data on this report is gathere from multiple sources.
First source is the pre populated csv file twitter_archive_enhanced.csv, the second source is a file generated by a neural network prediciting dogs's race based on their pictures and the final source is from twitter's API to get more info from the twitter user's account directly.
